# Fibergo

My attempt to master Fiber in Golang.

To see live server you can type:
- make watch

Endpoint can be reach at:
- POST, GET: localhost:3000/api/note
- GET, PUT, DELETE: localhost:3000/api/note/noteId

This project is based on tutorial by Gaurav Mehra aka Percoguru
at https://dev.to/percoguru/getting-started-with-apis-in-golang-feat-fiber-and-gorm-2n34
